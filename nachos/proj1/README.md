The main functionalities are divided among several Python files:

Alarm.java: Uses the hardware timer to provide preemption, and to allow threads to sleep until a certain time.

How Well It Worked
The project was largely successful. We passed all basic tests and the methods implemented are all functional. We also implemented more tests to make sure all conditions are handled. 

Testing  
We tested our code using a variety of methods:

Unit tests to ensure individual functions work as expected.
Manually running the program with different datasets/scenarios.
