Project Overview  
This project aims to provide a basic operating system with Nachos. We implemented various algorithms and methods such as waitFor.

Code Description  
The main functionalities are divided among several Python files to achieve file system calls, multiprogramming, and other system calls like exec. 

How Well It Worked
The project was largely successful. We passed all basic tests and the methods implemented are all functional. We also implemented more tests to make sure all conditions are handled. 

Testing  
We tested our code using a variety of methods:

Unit tests to ensure individual functions work as expected.
Manually running the program with different datasets/scenarios.

Contributions  
[Peike Xu]: Mainly focused on implementation of Part1 by implementing creat, open, read, write, close, and unlink.Also Colaborate on debugging other parts.
[Averi Yu]: I worked mainly on part 2 of this project and helped debug others. I worked on UserKernal and UserProcess classes with functions UserKernal.initialize(), UserProcess.readVirtualMemory, etc. I debugged them with the given tests and Gradescope, further adding tests. 
[Arron Li ]: Implements part3 of this project and Colaborate on debugging other parts. Mainly modified the handle exit, halt, join and exec.
